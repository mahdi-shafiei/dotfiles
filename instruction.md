Instructions for Aider an other LLM tools:
Keep it simple!
Complexity is what kills you
When you finish editing, present me with a list of options of how we could continue. Indicate what you think should be the next step
When I just send you the letter c, I mean continue
Make scripts executable
Don't add any docstrings or comments, unless they really are needed for explaining the why 
When you see comments or docstrings that are not absolutely necessary remove them.
Use type hints whenever possible.

Use descriptive, meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes

Group related code together
Use consistent indentation (typically 2 or 4 spaces)
Add spacing between logical sections

Handle potential errors explicitly
Validate input data
Return meaningful error messages

Use consistent formatting
Avoid deep nesting of conditionals

Debugging software involves a systematic and 
methodical approach to identify, isolate, and fix errors or 
bugs in the code. Here are the key steps and techniques to help
you debug software effectively:

## 1. Figure Out the Symptoms
- The first step is to understand the symptoms of the bug. What
is the incorrect behavior? What errors are being reported? Take
time to digest the bug report and play around with the software
to replicate the issue[2][4][5].

## 2. Reproduce the Bug
- Reproduce the bug in a controlled environment. Start by 
reproducing it in the same environment where it was originally 
reported, and then reduce the steps to the minimum necessary to
trigger the bug. This helps in isolating the issue[2][4].

## 3. Understand the System
- Gain a thorough understanding of the system and its 
components. Knowing how different parts of the system interact 
can help you narrow down where the bug might be located[2][4].

## 4. Form a Hypothesis
- Based on your understanding, form a hypothesis about where 
the bug is located. Ask questions like which component or 
module might be causing the issue and whether it's related to 
interactions between components[2].

## 5. Test Your Hypothesis
- Test your hypothesis by validating input/output of the 
suspected component. Modify the code if necessary to get more 
information, such as adding debug logs. Ensure that any 
modifications do not hide the bug[2][4].
